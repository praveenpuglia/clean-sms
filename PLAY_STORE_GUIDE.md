- That you don't share data with third parties

**Options**:
1. Use a privacy policy generator (e.g., https://app-privacy-policy-generator.nisrulz.com/)
2. Host it on GitHub Pages (free)
3. Use a simple website/blog
4. Example template provided below

**Privacy Policy Template** (customize as needed):

# Privacy Policy for Clean SMS

Last updated: November 7, 2025

Clean SMS ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information.

## Information Collection and Use

The App requires the following permissions to function:
- **SMS Permissions**: To read, send, and receive text messages
- **Contacts Permissions**: To display contact names and phone numbers
- **Phone Permissions**: To handle phone number formatting

### Data Storage
All data remains on your device. We do not:
- Collect or upload your messages to any server
- Share your data with third parties
- Track your usage or behavior
- Store data on external servers

### Data Usage
Your SMS messages and contacts are only used to:
- Display your message threads
- Send and receive SMS messages
- Show contact names in conversations
- Detect and display OTP codes in notifications

## Security
All data is stored locally on your Android device using Android's secure storage mechanisms.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. Changes will be posted with an updated revision date.

## Contact Us

### Step 3: Prepare App Store Assets

#### Required Graphics:

1. **App Icon** (already have)
   - 512x512 PNG
   - No alpha channel
   - Extract from `app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png` and upscale

2. **Feature Graphic** (REQUIRED): `play-store-assets/feature-graphic.png` (1024x500)

3. **Screenshots**: `play-store-assets/screenshots/01-08*.png` (1080x1920, upload in order)
   - Regenerate on the Pixel emulator: `./gradlew installDebug && play-store-assets/capture.sh && play-store-assets/render.sh`
   - `capture.sh` uses the debug demo seed (fictional people and brands, so no real company's name or logo
     appears in the listing); copy and layout live in `play-store-assets/frames.html`

4. **Optional but Recommended**:
   - Video (YouTube): 30s-2min demo
   - Tablet screenshots (if supporting tablets)

**App Name** (30 chars max):
```
Clean SMS
```

**Short Description** (80 chars max):
```
